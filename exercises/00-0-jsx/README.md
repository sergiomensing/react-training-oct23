# 00-0-jsx

In this exercise we [learn about JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx).

## Assignment

You can find the assignment inside `src/index.tsx`.

## Development

This project is using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/why.html).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

> See the section about [building for production](https://vitejs.dev/guide/build.html) for more information.

#### `yarn preview`

Once you ran `yarn build` a `dist` folder is generated. To preview the production build (the contents in this folder) run `yarn preview`.
