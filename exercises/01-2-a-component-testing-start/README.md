# 01-2-component-testing

In this exercise we learn how to [test a component with Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/getting-started#Your-First-Component-Test).

## Assignment

You can find the assignment inside `src/index.tsx`.

## Development

See the [README of 00-0-jsx](../00-0-jsx/README.md#development) for info and available scripts.

## Testing

This project is using [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn cypress`

This will open the Cypress app, from there you can select a [testing type](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/core-concepts/testing-types) and a browser. After that you can start testing!
